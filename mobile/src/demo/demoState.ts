/**
 * THE DEMO'S OWN LITTLE DATABASE.
 *
 * Everything the demo build creates — the cart, the orders, the order
 * numbering — lives in ONE JSON file in the app's private document directory
 * on the phone. Nothing here ever leaves the device.
 *
 * WHY A FILE AND NOT SECURE STORE. `expo-secure-store` is the project's
 * session store, but Android warns above ~2 KB per value and the demo's order
 * list comfortably exceeds that. `expo-file-system` has no such limit, is
 * already a dependency, is used elsewhere in the app for PDFs, and needs no
 * network at any point.
 *
 * THE FILE IS THE DEMO'S ENTIRE WORLD. Deleting it (Reset Demo Data, or
 * clearing the app's storage) returns the demo to an EMPTY order list, and can
 * have no effect on anything outside this phone.
 *
 * THERE IS NO SAMPLE ORDER HISTORY. The demo used to seed twelve invented
 * orders so the list was never blank. It no longer does: a fresh demo starts
 * with NO orders at all, and the only orders it will ever show are the ones
 * the hotel places in front of you. Nothing is filtered or hidden to achieve
 * that — the orders array genuinely starts empty.
