/**
 * ===================================================================
 * RIDER STORE — duty state, position pings, and the offer watch
 * ===================================================================
 *
 * WHY THIS POLLS INSTEAD OF LISTENING
 *
 * The backend already emits every rider event over Socket.IO
 * (`rider:job-offer`, `rider:job-taken`, `rider:nearby-order`), but the
 * mobile app has no socket client — `socket.io-client` is not a
 * dependency of this project, and adding one is a bundling decision
 * that belongs to whoever owns the app's dependency list rather than
 * something to slip in with a feature.
 *
 * So the app polls while the rider is on duty. With a 90-second offer
 * TTL a 10-second poll is comfortably inside the window, and a rider
 * never sees an offer they cannot still accept. When a socket client is
 * added, `startWatch` is the one place that changes: the emits are
 * already there, waiting for a listener.
 *
 * POLLING ONLY WHILE ONLINE. An off-duty rider makes no requests at
 * all — no position, no offers. Duty is a real switch, not a label.

const OFFER_POLL_MS = 10_000;

/**
 * A FIXED POSITION FOR TESTING, instead of the device's real GPS.
 *
 * A rider's position is pinged every twenty seconds, so a coordinate set by
 * hand in the database is overwritten before anyone can use it. That makes it
 * impossible to test dispatch against a chosen location from a phone that is
 * somewhere else — the phone always wins.
 *
 * Set EXPO_PUBLIC_RIDER_MOCK_LAT and EXPO_PUBLIC_RIDER_MOCK_LNG in
 * mobile/.env and the rider app reports that point instead, for going on duty
 * and for every ping after it.
 *
 * Guarded by __DEV__ for the same reason the service-area bypass is: Expo
 * inlines EXPO_PUBLIC_* at BUILD time, so a stray value in a build
 * environment would otherwise ship a release where every rider claims to be
 * standing in the same place. In a production build this is always null.
