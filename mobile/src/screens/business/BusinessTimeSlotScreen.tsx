 * Cart screen stays mounted underneath while this is open, which is what
 * keeps every item and quantity intact on the way back.
 *
 * THE BUSINESS NO LONGER SCHEDULES THE COLLECTION.
 *
 * This page used to carry two booking sections — "Pickup Details" and
 * "Delivery Details" — where the business picked a date and a time for each.
 * Both are gone. A Manager now sets the pickup when they accept the order,
 * which is why the business is not asked to guess at one: a business order is
 * created at PENDING_APPROVAL and waits for that acceptance before anything
 * is committed to.
 *
 * The page is therefore a REVIEW: what is in the order, and one button to
 * place it. The order's lifecycle is untouched — it still runs
 * Order Placed -> Pickup -> Processing -> Out for Delivery -> Delivered, and
 * the tracking screen still shows every one of those stages.
 *
 * THE PROVISIONAL PICKUP BELOW IS TEMPORARY. See `resolveProvisionalPickup`.

 * `pickupSlot.service.ts` throws before the order is written. The business
 * side no longer collects either, so one has to be supplied for the order to
 * be accepted at all.
 *
 * It is a PLACEHOLDER, not a promise. The order is created at
 * PENDING_APPROVAL and the Manager sets the real collection when they accept
 * it, overwriting this. Tomorrow's first slot is used rather than one later
 * today, for two reasons: it cannot go stale while the screen is open (a slot
 * today can start, and the server then refuses it), and it never reads as a
 * commitment to collect within the hour.
 *
 * DELETE THIS ONCE THE BACKEND STOPS REQUIRING A PICKUP. When the order
 * endpoint accepts a booking with no schedule and the Manager's accept step
 * writes it instead, this helper and its call site are the whole of what has
 * to be removed here — nothing else on this screen depends on it.
