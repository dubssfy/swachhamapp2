 * do not send any. No unit price, no line amount, no order total, no invoice
 * or payment figure reaches this screen, so there is nothing to conceal in
 * the markup and nothing to find in a network tab.
 *
 * The billing is unaffected by that: the server still recomputes the line
 * amount, the order subtotal and total, and the payment position, from the
 * order's own price snapshot, inside the same transaction that stores the
 * quantity. The shop floor's job is pieces; what those pieces are worth is a
 * billing question with no decision here resting on it.
 *
 * The final quantity below is plain subtraction the Sorter can check at a
 * glance. The server recomputes it too and its answer is what gets stored.
