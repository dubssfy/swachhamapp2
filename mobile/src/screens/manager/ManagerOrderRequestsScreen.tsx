/**
 * ORDER REQUESTS — the Manager's queues, and the pickup they assign.
 *
 * THE TWO PENDING TABS, because there are exactly two sources a booking can
 * come from: a customer (`orders.user_id`) or an establishment
 * (`orders.business_user_id`). The server derives the tab from whichever
 * column is set, so nothing is stored for the split and an order cannot
 * appear in both.
 *
 * A "REQUEST" HERE IS THE ORDER ITSELF, read at status PENDING_APPROVAL. There
 * is no request record beside it, so the order number shown here is the one
 * the Sorter and the Rider will work with after it is accepted — one row, one
 * id, all the way through.
 *
 * ============================================================
 * ACCEPTING NOW MEANS NAMING THE COLLECTION
 * ============================================================
 *
 * A Manager chooses a pickup DATE and TIME on the card before Accept will do
 * anything. The two are one decision — "yes, and we will collect it then" —
 * and the server refuses an acceptance without them, so this is not a
 * courtesy check that could be skipped by a stale build.
 *
 * NOTHING IS PRESELECTED. Defaulting the date to today, or the time to the
 * slot the customer happened to ask for, would let a Manager accept a
 * collection they never actually looked at. Both are deliberate taps.
 *
 * THE TIMES COME FROM THE SERVER, per date, and carry their own availability:
 * on today, one that has already gone by comes back unavailable and the pill
 * is dimmed and unpressable. The same list validates the acceptance, so the
 * picker cannot offer something the server will refuse.
 *
 * ============================================================
 * THE THIRD TAB
 * ============================================================
 *
 * Accepting takes an order out of the pending queues, so a pickup that needs
 * moving afterwards would have nowhere to be moved from. "Scheduled" lists
 * the accepted orders that have not been collected yet, soonest first, and
 * the same picker changes the time on one. The status is not touched: the
 * order keeps its place in the flow and only the collection moves.

 * so the list does not wait for a refresh to become right.
 *
