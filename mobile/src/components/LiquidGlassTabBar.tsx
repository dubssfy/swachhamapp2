 * concave scoop is not something a border radius can express: `borderRadius`
 * only ever rounds a corner outwards. The path runs along the top edge, dips
 * through a smooth curve at the centre and carries on, so the bar has a real
 * notch the logo sits INSIDE rather than a circle floating on a straight edge.
 *
 * The geometry itself lives in `tabBarNotch.ts` — pure, with no React Native
 * imports — so the curve can be measured on its own rather than eyeballed on
 * one phone. See `backend/scripts/smoke_tab_bar_notch.ts`, which checks across
 * device widths that the scoop never reaches an icon and never covers the icon
 * row.
 *
 * Both tab sets have four tabs, so the centre falls in the gap between tab 2
 * and tab 3 and the notch never lands on an icon.
