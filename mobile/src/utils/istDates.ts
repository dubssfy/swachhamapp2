/**
 * Indian Standard Time, for every Business scheduling decision.
 *
 * Swachham schedules in India. A device set to another timezone — or simply
 * left on UTC — must still be shown the Indian day and the Indian clock, so
 * nothing in the Business booking flow may call `new Date()` and read the
 * device's own calendar off it. Everything goes through this file.
 *
 * WHY FIXED-OFFSET ARITHMETIC. IST is UTC+05:30 and has been since 1945:
 * India observes no daylight saving, so a fixed offset is not an
 * approximation here, it is the definition. That keeps this correct without
 * `Intl` timezone data (which Hermes may ship trimmed) and without adding a
 * date library the project does not otherwise need.
 *
 * A "date key" throughout is YYYY-MM-DD — the same shape the API already
 * takes, and the shape `sorterDates` uses. Keys compare correctly as plain
 * strings, which is why every comparison below is a string comparison and
 * never a Date subtraction.
