 * Business contacts — the people and numbers a business is reached through.
 *
 * THEY LIVE IN `business_users`, WHICH IS THE ONLY PLACE THEY LIVE.
 *
 * There used to be three: five columns on `businesses`, a row in
 * `business_contacts`, and the `business_users` account row. Migration 031
 * folded all of it into `business_users`, so a number is recorded exactly
 * once and the login lookup and the invoice can no longer disagree about it.
 *
 *   contact_type = 'PRIMARY'      the business head; also the login account
 *   contact_type = 'ALTERNATIVE'  a further contact, one to three of them
 *
 * WHAT MAKES A ROW AN ACCOUNT is `password_hash`, not `contact_type`. A
 * PRIMARY row without one is a person on file who cannot yet sign in; an
 * ALTERNATIVE never has one, because an alternative contact is somebody to
 * ring, not a second set of credentials.
 *
 * WHAT THE MOBILE NUMBER DOES. Every contact's number — primary and
 * alternative alike — identifies the business at sign-in. `unifiedAuth`
 * resolves it to that business's login account, so an alternative contact
 * reaches the same business dashboard as the head, and `login_enabled` is
 * the Super Admin's switch for whether a given number may do that at all.
 * The number is proven by OTP; the password step that follows is unchanged.
 *
 * THE API SHAPE IS UNCHANGED. `contact_type` is reported as BUSINESS_HEAD /
 * ALTERNATIVE exactly as before, so the app's existing screens and types
 * keep working; only the table underneath moved.
