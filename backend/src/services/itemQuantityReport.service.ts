/**
 * THE DAY-WISE ITEM QUANTITY REPORT.
 *
 * The second document the Business Account produces, alongside the invoice:
 * a grid of ITEM NAME down the side, the DATES across the top, and the
 * quantity of that item collected on that date in each cell — with a Total
 * row closing every date column.
 *
 *              | 01-08 | 02-08 | 03-08 | Total
 *   Face Towel |     5 |       |     2 |     7
 *   Bath Towel |    10 |     3 |       |    13
 *   Total      |    15 |     3 |     2 |    20
 *
 * It answers a different question from the invoice. The invoice says what is
 * owed and groups every line by rate, so one item at two prices is two rows
 * and the dates are gone. This says how much of each item moved on each day,
 * which is what a hotel's housekeeping reconciles against its own counts.
 *
 * IT IS BUILT FROM THE SAME INPUTS AS THE INVOICE, deliberately: the same
 * business, the same two dates, the same laundry type, the same exclusion of
 * cancelled orders, and the same `CONVERT_TZ` into the business timezone that
 * decides which day an order near midnight belongs to. Two documents covering
 * "the same period" have to mean the same thing by it.
 *
 * QUANTITY IS THE BILLABLE QUANTITY — `order_items.quantity`, the figure the
 * invoice charges for, after any defective pieces were taken off. The pieces
 * originally collected are carried alongside it so a discrepancy against the
 * hotel's own count has an explanation on the page rather than a query.
