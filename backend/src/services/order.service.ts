/**
 * The tracking view of one order, for the customer who placed it.
 *
 * ASSEMBLED IN JS, NOT IN SQL — the same treatment, and for the same reason,
 * as `getOrderById` above. This function was still the original PostgreSQL:
 * `row_to_json(pk.*)`, `json_agg(...) FILTER (WHERE ...)` and
 * `json_build_object`, none of which MySQL has. It could never have run here,
 * and every call to it answered 500 with a SQL syntax error — which is what
 * "Track my order does not work" was.
 *
 * Three other faults went with it, all of which would still have broken the
 * query after the JSON functions were replaced:
 *
 *   `o.total_amount` DOES NOT EXIST. The column is `orders.total`; the API
 *   exposes it under the `total_amount` name, which is why the wrong one
 *   looks plausible. It is aliased here so the response keeps that name.
 *
 *   `production_status_history` HAS NO `production_order_id`. It is keyed by
 *   `order_id`, so the join could not have matched a row.
 *
 *   IT WAS NOT SCOPED TO A USER. Any signed-in account could track any
 *   order by guessing an id, reading its number, status and schedule. It now
 *   takes `userId` and filters on it, exactly as `getOrderById` does — a null
 *   for someone else's order rather than a disclosure.
