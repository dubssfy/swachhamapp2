 *   1. An order is placed. Riders near the pickup point get an ADVISORY
 *      — "work is coming your way" — and nothing more. No job exists yet
 *      and none can be accepted, because the order has not been
 *      confirmed by anyone.
 *
 *   2. The SORTER accepts the order. That is the confirmation, and only
 *      then is a real pickup job created.
 *
 *   3. The job is OFFERED to the nearest online riders at once. The
 *      first to accept takes it; every other offer is superseded and
 *      the card clears from their phones.
 *
 * Offering to several riders rather than assigning to the single
 * closest one is deliberate. The closest rider may be looking at their
 * handlebars, and an order that waits for one person to notice is an
 * order that waits. Fan-out with first-accept-wins is what keeps the
 * pickup moving without a human dispatcher.

 * UNASSIGNED on its first and only dispatch.
 *
 * Nothing then looked at it again. `dispatchJob` itself accepts an UNASSIGNED
 * job perfectly well (see its status guard), so the job was always
 * re-dispatchable — but this sweep, the only thing that retries automatically,
 * could not see it. A rider coming on duty five minutes later never learned
 * the order existed, and no amount of refreshing helped.
 *
 * Including UNASSIGNED closes that. The attempts bound is unchanged, so a job
