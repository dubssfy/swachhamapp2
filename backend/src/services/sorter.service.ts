 *
 * NO PRICE REACHES THIS MODULE'S CALLERS. Not the unit price, not the line
 * amount, not the order total, not the invoice or payment position.
 *
 * The shop floor's job is pieces: how many arrived, how many are damaged, how
 * many are finished. What those pieces are worth is a billing question, and
 * the Sorter has no decision that depends on the answer — the backend does
 * every calculation itself, from the order's own snapshot, and ignores
 * anything a client sends about price.
 *
 * THIS IS ENFORCED IN THE PAYLOAD, NOT IN THE UI. Hiding a field in React
 * leaves it in the JSON for anyone who opens the network tab; the fields are
 * therefore never selected, never mapped and never returned. `SorterOrderItem`
 * and `SorterAdjustmentRecord` below are the whole of what a Sorter session
 * can learn about an order's money, which is nothing.

 * completes the rider's job without advancing the order. Orders were reaching
 * the facility and becoming invisible to the people meant to process them.
 *
 * `confirmed` is PICKED_UP, so the order joins the queue the moment the rider

 *
 * `white_cloth_count` is what the Sorter counted off the pile. The defective
 * pieces are NOT subtracted here, and the reason is the order the shop floor
 * actually works in.
 *
 * These were briefly returned net of defects. That reads well if the counting
 * happens first — count 20, mark 3 defective, see 17 — but the Sorter marks
 * defects first at least as often, and then the sum breaks down: they type 20
 * meaning "there are 20 white", a net-aware save stores 23 to compensate, and
 * the box redisplays 20 having apparently ignored the defect entirely.
 *
 * So the stored figure and the edited figure are both the ORIGINAL count, in
 * every order of operations, and the subtraction happens where it can be
 * SEEN: the screen shows the original in the box and the updated figure
 * beside it, and the read-only card after acceptance shows the updated one.
 *
 * That is also what makes a repeated save safe. The box always holds the
 * original, so saving it back stores the original again — there is no figure
 * that shrinks each time it makes the round trip, and a defect corrected from
 * 3 to 5 recomputes from the count rather than compounding on it.
 *
 * The batch weight calculation subtracts the defect itself, in SQL, from this
 * same stored figure — see BATCHABLE_QUANTITY_SQL in sorterBatch.service.
