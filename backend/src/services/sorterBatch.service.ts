/* ===================================================================
 * SORTER BATCH PROCESSING
 * ===================================================================
 *
 * The database side of batch processing. Every read and every write lives
 * here; the algorithm itself is `batchOptimizer.service.ts`, which is pure and
 * knows nothing about SQL.
 *
 *   sorter.routes  ->  sorterBatch.service  ->  batchOptimizer.service
 *                              |
 *                           database
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT TOUCH
 *
 * It never writes `orders.status`, `order_items.item_status`,
 * `order_items.quantity`, any price, any invoice, or any acceptance/delivery
 * garment scan. Batching happens entirely INSIDE the existing
 * RECEIVED_AT_FACILITY stage: an order is approved by the Sorter exactly as it
 * always was, it may then be batched, and it is marked ready exactly as it
 * always was. Removing every line of this feature would leave the existing
 * workflow behaving identically.
 *
 * WHY APPROVAL IS THE GATE
 *
 * The Sorter's approval is the existing transition ORDER_PLACED ->
 * RECEIVED_AT_FACILITY, audited by `orders.accepted_at` / `accepted_by` since
 * migration 017. That IS the approval record, so no second approval flag was
 * invented: `status = 'RECEIVED_AT_FACILITY' AND accepted_at IS NOT NULL` is
 * the eligibility rule, and `accepted_at` is also the priority clock.
