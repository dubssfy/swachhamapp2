/**
 * MANAGER APPROVAL — the gate every booking now passes through.
 *
 * ============================================================
 * WHAT THIS CHANGES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
 * ============================================================
 *
 * A Customer or Business booking is created at PENDING_APPROVAL (migration
 * 053) instead of ORDER_PLACED. This is the only thing that moves it on.
 *
 * THERE IS NO SECOND ORDER, AND NO REQUEST TABLE. A "request" here IS the
 * order row, read at one status. Approving it is an UPDATE of that row's
 * status, so the id, the number, the items, the pickup and the delivery are
 * the same records throughout -- Customer, Business, Manager, Sorter, Rider
 * and the tracker are all looking at one `orders` row.
 *
 * ============================================================
 * WHY THE SORTER AND RIDER NEEDED NO CHANGES
 * ============================================================
 *
 * Both were already gated on the order's status:
 *
 *   SORTER  `sorter.service`'s queue is `status IN (ORDER_PLACED, ...)`.
 *           PENDING_APPROVAL is not in that list, so a pending booking is
 *           invisible to it and an accepted one appears -- with the query
 *           untouched.
 *
 *   RIDER   a PICKUP job is created and dispatched here, through the same
 *           `createJobForOrder` + `dispatchJob` pair `sorter.service` already
 *           calls. See "WHY THE RIDER NEEDED MORE THAN AN ADVISORY" below.
 *
 * ============================================================
 * WHY THE RIDER NEEDED MORE THAN AN ADVISORY
 * ============================================================
 *
 * The first cut of this moved `notifyNearbyRidersOfNewOrder` from order
 * creation to here. THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH, and it is why the rider half of the
 * flow did not work: that function only sends nearby riders a NOTIFICATION.
 * It writes no `rider_jobs` row, and its own message says so -- "you will be
 * offered the pickup once it is confirmed". With no job there is no offer, so
 * `GET /api/rider/offers` and `GET /api/rider/jobs` were both empty and the
 * order never reached a rider.
 *
 * The real job was created in one place only: `sorter.service`, when the
 * SORTER moved the order to `accepted`. That was right when the Sorter was
 * the one confirming an order -- but confirmation is the MANAGER's decision
 * now, and the requirement is that the rider sees the order at Order Placed.
 * So the pickup is created at the same moment the Manager accepts.
 *
 * NOTHING IS DUPLICATED BY THIS. `createJobForOrder` looks for an existing
 * (order, job type) row first and returns it rather than inserting a second,
 * so the Sorter's `accepted` step -- which still runs, unchanged -- finds this
 * job instead of making another. The DELIVERY job is still the Sorter's, at
 * `out_for_delivery`, which this does not touch.
 *
 * ============================================================
 * THE TWO TABS ARE ONE COLUMN
 * ============================================================
 *
 * An order carries EITHER `user_id` (a customer placed it) or
 * `business_user_id` (an establishment did). That column is the existing
 * source information, so the split needs nothing recorded for it: the two
 * queues are the same query with opposite predicates, and an order can no
 * more appear in both than it can have both columns set.

 *      in the same timezone rather than comparing an IST wall clock against

 *      pickup minute has fully passed. "Now" is truncated to the minute so

 *
 * A pickup with no time recorded is treated as the end of its day rather than
 * dropped on the spot — it has a date, and nothing says it is late yet.
 *
 * One SQL fragment, used by the list AND by the reschedule guard, so what is

   *
   * IT REACHES A HOTEL AS WELL AS A CUSTOMER, which the call it replaces did
   * not. That call wrote a `notifications` row, whose foreign key points at
   * `users` — so a business order, which has `business_user_id` and no
   * `user_id`, silently notified nobody about the one thing it most needed
   * to know. `notifyOrderPartyOnce` resolves the party first and writes the
   * table that party can actually read.
   *
   * ONE NOTIFICATION, NOT TWO. Approving and scheduling are one decision
   * here — `acceptOrder` does both in a single transaction — so they are one
   * message. Sending "Order Placed" and "Pickup Scheduled" a millisecond
   * apart would buzz a phone twice for one event.
   *
   * THE KEY CARRIES THE ASSIGNED TIME. A Manager who opens this order and
   * saves the SAME collection again produces the same key and sends nothing;
   * one who moves it to a different time produces a different key and the
   * customer hears about it. See `reschedulePickup`, which shares the key
   * shape for exactly that reason, and migration 072.
