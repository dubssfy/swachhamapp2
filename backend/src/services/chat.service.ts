/**
 * Swachham — the in-app assistant.
 *
 * There is no LLM anywhere in this project and no model credentials in the
 * environment, so this does not call one. Every answer is composed here, on
 * the server, from two sources and nothing else:
 *
 *   1. The workflow this application actually implements, written out below.
 *   2. Live rows — the service types in the catalogue, and the caller's own
 *      orders.
 *
 * That is a deliberate trade: the assistant cannot hold an open-ended
 * conversation, but it also cannot invent a service, a price, a delivery
 * window or a policy, which is the one thing it must never do. Anything it
 * has no grounded answer for is declined and pointed at support.
 *
 * The answer text lives on the server, so the wording can be corrected
 * without shipping a new build, and nothing about how it is produced is
 * exposed to the app.
