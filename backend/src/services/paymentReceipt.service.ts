/**
 * ===================================================================
 * PAYMENT RECEIPTS — money received from a business
 * ===================================================================
 *
 * THE FOUR FIGURES, and the one rule that ties them together:
 *
 *   Previous Balance        what was still outstanding before this invoice
 *   Current Invoice Amount  what this invoice itself came to
 *   Total Amount Due        Previous Balance + Current Invoice Amount
 *   Remaining Balance       Total Amount Due - Payment Received
 *
 * The remaining balance of the LAST receipt is the previous balance of the
 * NEXT one, which is how an unpaid amount carries forward. Paying an invoice
 * in full leaves zero and the next invoice starts clean; paying part of it
 * leaves the difference, and it follows the business until it is paid.
 *
 * THE BALANCE IS READ FROM THE LEDGER, NOT FROM A SCREEN. `previousBalanceFor`
 * takes it from the last stored receipt, so a refresh, a second window or a
 * different administrator all compute the same number, and a client that posts
 * its own figure cannot move it.
 *
 * THE ARITHMETIC IS DONE HERE, TWICE OVER. The client shows a running total
 * as the amount is typed, but nothing it sends is trusted: `previous_balance`,
 * `total_amount_due` and `remaining_balance` are all recomputed on the server
 * before the row is written, from the invoice and the ledger.
 *
 * NO ORDER OR INVOICE IS EVER MODIFIED. A receipt is a separate financial
 * record ABOUT an invoice. Recording one does not touch `orders`,
 * `order_items` or any total; an invoice states what was charged, and stays
 * stating it however much has since been paid.
 *
 * INVOICES ARE COMPUTED, NOT STORED. `gstInvoice.service` builds one on demand
 * from the orders in a billing period, so there is no invoices table to
 * reference — the receipt keeps the invoice number as text together with the
 * period it covers, which is what makes the same invoice rebuildable.
