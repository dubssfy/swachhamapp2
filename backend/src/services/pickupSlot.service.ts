/**
 * The placeholder pickup an order is created with when NOBODY HAS CHOSEN ONE.
 *
 * ============================================================
 * WHY AN ORDER STILL HAS A PICKUP ROW NOBODY ASKED FOR
 * ============================================================
 *
 * Neither a customer nor a business picks a collection time any more — the
 * Manager does, when they accept the booking (`managerOrderApproval`). But
 * `pickups` is not optional in this schema: every order has had a row in it
 * since the first migration, and the rider's job, the delivery-turnaround
 * rule and several reports all read it. An order with no row there is an
 * order those readers cannot see.
 *
 * So a row is written, with a placeholder, and `orders.assigned_pickup_date`
 * stays NULL — which is the column every screen actually tests to decide
 * whether to show a collection at all (see migration 059). The placeholder is
 * operational scaffolding; it is never shown to anyone and never described as
 * an appointment.
 *
 * ============================================================
 * WHY IT LIVES HERE AND NOT IN THE APP
 * ============================================================
 *
 * The Business checkout screen used to compute this itself, and said in its
 * own comment that it should be deleted once the server stopped insisting on
 * a schedule. The server has now stopped insisting — so the placeholder moved
 * to the one place that owns the working day, rather than being re-derived on
 * each client from a hardcoded slot id. Two clients guessing at a placeholder
 * is two chances to guess differently.
 *
 * ============================================================
 * TOMORROW'S FIRST SLOT, NOT A SLOT TODAY
 * ============================================================
 *
 * A slot today can already have started, and every validator here refuses a
 * start time in the past — so a placeholder today would be rejected by the
 * very rules it exists to satisfy. Tomorrow's opening slot is always valid,
 * and it cannot be mistaken for a promise to collect within the hour.
