 * `time_slot_end` — which is where the customer order flow already writes
 * its own schedule. No new column and no new table.
 *

 * hardcoding it, and the same list validates what comes back, so the two can
 * never drift apart. Pickup and delivery draw on the SAME list: there is one
 * working day, not one per leg.
 *
 * TIMEZONE. Every comparison is made in the business timezone (IST) through
 * `utils/istTime`, never against the database server's UTC clock. A pickup
 * booked at 00:30 IST is on today's date, not yesterday's.
