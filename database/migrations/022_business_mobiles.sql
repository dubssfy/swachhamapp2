-- SWACHHAM — Many mobile numbers per business
-- Migration: 022_business_mobiles.sql
--
-- A business is reached on more than one number, and any of them
-- should be able to sign in to that business. Until now a number
-- lived in two places that could disagree: businesses.mobile_number
-- and business_users.mobile_number. Business 1 already had two
-- different values across those columns.
--
-- business_mobiles becomes the single list. The old columns are
-- left in place and still read as a fallback, so nothing that
-- currently works stops working.
--
-- How many a business may hold is per-business and set by the super
-- admin (businesses.max_mobiles). The backfill seeds that allowance
-- from what each business already has, so no business starts over
-- its own limit. One number is always compulsory, which is enforced
-- in the service on delete rather than by a constraint that could
-- not explain itself.
--
-- Idempotent. MySQL only.
