-- ============================================================
-- SWACHHAM — Remove business_mobiles
-- Migration: 029_drop_business_mobiles.sql
--
-- WHY IT GOES.
--
-- 022 added `business_mobiles` as a second list of numbers a
-- business answers on, at a time when there was no contact
-- structure. 027 then introduced `business_contacts`, which holds
-- the Business Head and one to three Alternative Contacts, each
-- with a name, a designation and a mobile number, and 028 gave
-- each contact `login_enabled`.
--
-- That makes `business_mobiles` a duplicate of a thing the schema
-- already models better: a bare number with no owner, no role and
-- no login switch. Two lists of "numbers this business answers
-- on" can disagree, and the login lookup had to read both.
--
-- WHAT WAS CHECKED BEFORE DROPPING IT.
--
--   unifiedAuth.service          the mobile -> business lookup now
--                                joins business_contacts and
--                                honours login_enabled
--   businessMobiles.service      deleted
--   /profile/mobiles routes      deleted (business self-service)
--   /businesses/:id/mobiles      deleted (super admin)
--   BusinessMobilesSection.tsx   deleted (mobile app)
--   superAdminApi mobile calls   deleted
--
-- No foreign key points AT business_mobiles; its own FK points at
-- businesses, so dropping the table breaks no other table. No
-- foreign key checks are disabled anywhere in this migration.
--
-- NO CONTACT DATA IS LOST. Before the drop, any number that lives
-- ONLY in business_mobiles is carried over into business_contacts
-- as an Alternative Contact, within the 3-contact maximum the
-- service enforces. Numbers already present as a contact, and the
-- business's own primary number, are skipped rather than
-- duplicated.
--
-- Idempotent. MySQL only. No business, order, invoice or price row
-- is touched.
-- ============================================================

-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. CARRY OVER ANYTHING THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE LOST
--
-- Only runs while the table still exists, so a re-run after the
-- drop is a no-op rather than an error.
--
-- `rn` ranks the candidate numbers per business and the join
-- caps the result at three contacts in total, which is the same
-- 1..3 rule businessContact.service enforces. login_enabled is
-- left at its default of TRUE so nothing that worked stops
-- working; the Super Admin can turn it off per contact.

-- `@has_bm` alone is not enough: replaying 022 recreates `business_mobiles`,

-- column this statement compares against is gone -- which aborted the run.

-- 2. DROP THE TABLE

--
-- `businesses.max_mobiles` was added by 022 solely to cap how many
-- business_mobiles rows a business could hold. With the table gone
-- it has no reader, and the 1..3 rule for alternative contacts is
-- enforced in businessContact.service instead. Gated so a re-run
-- does nothing.
