-- ============================================================
-- SWACHHAM — Business pricing per laundry type
-- Migration: 026_business_price_laundry_type.sql
--
-- A business pays a different rate for its own linen (Hotel
-- Laundry) than for its guests' clothes (Guest Laundry), so a
-- business price is no longer identified by (business, item)
-- alone -- the laundry type is part of the key.
--
--   before:  UNIQUE (business_id, item_id)
--   after:   UNIQUE (business_id, item_id, laundry_type)
--
-- NAMING. `laundry_type` reuses the enum the schema already
-- uses on `orders` and `carts` -- ENUM('hotel','guest') -- so
-- there is one vocabulary for the concept across the database.
-- The API additionally accepts HOTEL_LAUNDRY / GUEST_LAUNDRY
-- and normalises to these values.
--
-- EXISTING ROWS. A row written before this migration carried no
-- laundry type, which means it applied to whichever type was
-- ordered -- i.e. to both. It is therefore expanded into two
-- rows at the same price, one per type, which preserves the
-- previous behaviour exactly. Nothing is guessed and no price
-- is invented or changed. (This database has no rows in the
-- table, so the expansion is a no-op here; it is written for
-- any environment that does.)
--
-- Idempotent. MySQL only. No drops, no deletes, no price edited.

--
-- Migration 042 widens the key again to include the service, and drops this
-- one. The runner replays every file in order, so on a later run this step
-- would re-add a key that 042 has already replaced -- and once a business
-- holds two prices for one item at one laundry type (its base rate and a
-- Dry Clean rate, which is exactly what 042 exists to allow) re-adding a key
-- on (business, item, type) FAILS on duplicates and aborts the whole run.
--
-- So it is skipped when 042's key is present. The table still has a
-- uniqueness guarantee throughout -- 042's is simply the stronger one.

-- ORDER LINE SNAPSHOT
--

-- the rate from the order header.

-- order was actually placed under. That is the same fact, not an
-- assumption. Left NULL where the order has none.

-- ============================================================
-- DELIVERY SCHEDULING IS OPTIONAL
--
-- No DDL is needed. A delivery lives in its own `deliveries`
-- row, one per order, so "no delivery booked yet" is the absence
-- of that row -- which the schema already permits, and which the
-- order queries already LEFT JOIN for. Making the columns
-- nullable instead would allow a delivery row that says nothing,
-- which is a worse representation of the same fact.
--
-- The row is inserted when the delivery is scheduled, whether
-- that happens with the order or afterwards.
